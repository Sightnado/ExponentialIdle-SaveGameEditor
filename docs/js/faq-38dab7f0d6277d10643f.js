Why did you create this?","I was curious how the game worked internally. So I decided to make this app a by-product of that information."],["#2. Why do you require an in-game purchase to use this app?","Initially, I didn\'t have this in place. However, I realized that this app can give you the advantages of one of the in-game purchases (Permanent Ad Reward). This means the app could lessen the game creator\'s monetary support. So, I either had to kill this project or implement the purchase requirement."],["#3. This app is open source, but why is part of it obfuscated? What are you hiding?","The obfuscated file is <kbd>crypto.js</kbd>. This is the file that handles the decryption, encryption, and in-game purchase verification.<br /><br />Yes, JavaScript obfuscation is reversible. Still, I believe that anyone who is successful at deobfuscation could decrypt the save games themselves anyway.<br /><br />Anyone wishing to have a closer look at this file for security purposes can contact me."],["#4. Why did you make this open-source at all?","It is my deepest hope that someone can use any or all of this code to learn something new."],["#5. Where did the translations come from?","The game has a beautiful language mechanism and a fantastic team of translators. Where possible, I tried to use game keywords so that this app could be automatically translated, even at a small cost of clarity."],["#6. I am one of the authors of one of the translations. Unfortunately, I do not want you to use my work. Can you remove it?","Send a pull request with the <kbd>src/lib/i18n.json</kbd> file edited and proof that you are its author to remove your work."],["#7. I would like to add a language or fix some translations. Can I do that?","Contact the game owner and work with them to include your translations into the main game. Any translations added there, I will port."],["#8. The app doesn\'t work!","Make an issue in this app\'s Github repo following the proper issue guidelines."],["#9. The app corrupted my save!","As clearly noted on the main page, this app is not responsible for any broken save. Therefore, make a backup of your save first."],["#10. The app froze my phone!","This can happen if the game attempts to load an invalid save. If this happens, please make an issue in this app\'s Github repo and include what you changed."],["#11. What are some practical, non-cheaty things you can do?","<ul><li>Automatically update your permanent star levels and students without having to enter each value into the game manually.</li><li>Recover your game if you lost it and don\'t want to start over.</li><li>See more accurate numbers that get truncated in game for space saving reasons.</li><li>Edit long auto-prestige and auto-supremacy formulas easier.</li><li>Test different game play methods quickly to find optimal speed running strategies.</li></ul>"],["#12. What are some practical, kinda-cheaty things you can do?","<ul><li>Change the current in-game time to speed through offline progress (maximum 1 week at a time).</li><li>Change the automation rate to be much faster than what the star bonus reward gives you. Careful; you might lag your game!</li><li>Unlock the minigames early because you fucking love minigames.</li><li>Unlock auto-buy for Theories you haven\'t even unlocked yet; skip the initial grind!</li><li>Change the default acceleration rate to act like you\'re always holding the acceleration button.</li></ul>"],["#13. What are some practical, super-cheaty things you can do?","This is a complete save game editor. Just give yourself a boatload of currencies, stars, upgrades, etc...Get an imagination!"],["#14. What\'s the Raw Data section?","This is all the data from the save game in its <em>(mostly)</em> raw form. Editing values in other sections will update the Raw Data section as well, sometimes in multiple places. Be careful editing directly in this area as there are fewer checks for invalid inputs."],["#15. I changed some things, but they didn\'t affect the game at all. What things can you not do?","Some of the items require something to be changed in multiple places in <kbd>Raw Data</kbd>. If you\'re directly editing in <kbd>Raw Data</kbd> you may need to edit things in multiple places.<br /><br />There are also some things in the save game that the game will not load when doing an import from paste:<ul><li>Any of the items in <kbd>Raw Data > Option</kbd></li><li>Any of the items in <kbd>Raw Data > Rewards</kbd></li><li>Any of the items in <kbd>Raw Data > Session</kbd> that relate to purchases or asks.</li><li><kbd>Raw Data > Session > HasGoneBackwardInTime</kbd></li><li>Any of the items in <kbd>Raw Data > Statistics</kbd> that relate to installation time.</li>"],["#16. What about other games?","If the game works similarly (import/export of save games), and the game is interesting in its nature, send me an email."]]')}}]);
